# Functional TS

An example of a small project based on ports/adapters pattern.

## Concepts

1. ports/adapters pattern with use of repositories
2. use of Either to handle errors without throw
3. use of Higer Order Function for logging
4. implicit implementation for repositories
5. use of fake implementation for testing

## Tests

`npm run start`

## Start

`npm start`
